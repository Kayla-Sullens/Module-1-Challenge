# Module-1-Challenge

## Description

This challenge assignment was completed to showcase skills on basic HTML and CSS. A starter code was given, and needed to be refactored to meet certain acceptance criteria. The CSS style sheet also needed to be consolidated and have errors fixed. The goal was to fix any errors present to ensure the webpage would look as it should and function correctly. I completed this assignment to improve my skills working with HTML and CSS, and work on finding errors and debugging. Now, this webpage looks exactly as it should with a nice, clean layout and the links all work correctly.
