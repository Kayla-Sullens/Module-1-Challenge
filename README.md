# Module-1-Challenge

## Description

This challenge assignment was completed to showcase skills on basic HTML and CSS. A starter code was given, and needed to be refactored 
to meet certain acceptance criteria. The CSS style sheet also needed to be consolidated and have errors fixed. The goal was to fix any
errors present to ensure the webpage would look as it should and function correctly. I completed this assignment to improve my skills 
working with HTML and CSS, and work on finding errors and debugging. Now, this webpage looks exactly as it should with a nice, clean 
layout and the links all work correctly.
